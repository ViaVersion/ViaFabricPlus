# Updating instructions for the project

These steps are the usual process for updating ViaFabricPlus to a new version of the game. If you're unsure about
something, ask in the ViaVersion discord.

1. Update all upstream versions in `gradle.properties`. The main versions you need to update are:
    - `minecraft_version`
    - `yarn_version`
    - `loader_version`
    - `fabric_api_version`

    - `supported_versions` (if necessary)

   As well as the versions in the `dependencies` block in the `build.gradle` file.
2. Increment the version number in `gradle.properties` by at least a minor version (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
3. Check all data dumps and diffs in the fixes/data package and update them if necessary, here is a list of some
   critical ones:
    - `ResourcePackHeaderDiff` (add the new version at the top of the list)
    - `ItemRegistryDiff` (add all new items/blocks added in the new version)
    - `EntityDimensionDiff` (add entity dimension changes)
4. Update the `NATIVE_VERSION` field in the ProtocolTranslator class to the new version
5. Update protocol constants in the `ViaFabricPlusProtocol` class

6. Check all mixins in the injection package if they still apply correctly, here is a list of some critical ones:
    - `MixinClientWorld#tickEntity` and `MixinClientWorld#tickPassenger`
    - `MixinPlayer#getBlockBreakingSpeed`
7. mDecompile the game source code with the tool of your choice.
8. Try to compile the mod and start porting the code until all existing fixes are working again.
9. Diff the game code with the code of the previous version (e.g. using git) and implement all changes that could be
   relevant for ViaFabricPlus, those are:
    - General logic changes (e.g. `if (a && b)` -> `if (b || a)`)
    - Changes to the movement code (e.g. `player.yaw` -> `player.headYaw`)
    - Networking changes (e.g. sending a new packet / changing the packet structure)
    - Changes to visuals (e.g. animation changes)
    - Note: ViaVersion already implements most gameplay related changes for us, but you should always check for
      edge-cases. Since ViaVersion
      is primarily a server side plugin, it does not take care of client-side related / deeper changes. ViaFabricPlus
      often has to inject into
      ViaVersion code to improve funcitonality for the client.

   added [HERE](../CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-protocol-new-fixes---which-are-important-and-which-arent)**

    - From experience, the following packages contain the usual important changes (mojang mappings):
        - `net.minecraft`
        - `net.minecraft.client`
            - `net.minecraft.client.gui`
            - `net.minecraft.client.multiplayer`
            - `net.minecraft.client.player`
        - `net.minecraft.util`
        - `net.minecraft.world`
            - `net.minecraft.world.entity`
            - `net.minecraft.world.inventory`
            - `net.minecraft.world.item`
            - `net.minecraft.world.level`
                - `net.minecraft.world.level.block`

    - While the following packages (mojang mappings) can be skipped completely (most of the time):
        - `com.mojang`
        - `net.minecraft.advancements`
        - `net.minecraft.commands`
        - `net.minecraft.data`
        - `net.minecraft.gametest`
        - `net.minecraft.realms`
        - `net.minecraft.recipebook`
        - `net.minecraft.references`
        - `net.minecraft.resources`
        - `net.minecraft.server`
        - `net.minecraft.sounds`
        - `net.minecraft.stats`
        - `net.minecraft.tags`

10. Check the ViaVersion/upstream protocol implementation for issues and report them if necessary or if these issues
    can't be fixed,
    without tons of work, implement a workaround in ViaFabricPlus.
11. Run the game and check all GUIs and other visuals for issues.
12. Clean your code and make sure it is readable and understandable, clientside fixes are sorted by their protocol
    versions, having
    newer fixes at the top of the file.

-------------

13. Create a pull request and wait for it to be reviewed and merged.
14. You're done, congrats!

## Git branches

- `main`: The main branch, this is where all changes are merged into
- `dev`: Used for changes which needs reviewing by all developers, usually merged into `main` shortly after
- `update/*`: Update branches, these are used to port ViaFabricPlus to newer versions of the game
- `<version>`: Final release branches sorted by their Minecraft version (e.g. `1.8.9`, `1.16.5`, `1.17.1`, ...)

There are also older formats which aren't used anymore:

- `recode/*`: Recode branches, these are used to port ViaFabricPlus to newer versions of the game or rewrite big parts
  of the code
- `backport/*`: Backport branches, these are used to backport newer ViaFabricPlus versions to older versions of the game

## Project structure

Every change made to the game is called a `feature`. Each feature has its package under both `features/` and
`injection/mixin/features/`, organizing utility and mixin classes for easier project maintenance and porting
Loading of features is done via `static` blocks and dummy `init` function called in the `FeaturesLoading` class.

## Versioning

The versioning should only be updated every release and should only have one update between each release.

- The versioning scheme is `major.minor.patch`, where:
    - `major` is incremented when breaking changes are made
    - `minor` is incremented when new features are added
    - `patch` is incremented when bug fixes are made

This scheme is used as follows:

- `Major` versions are only incremented with breaking and fundamental changes to the existing codebase, such as
  migrating mappings
  or refactoring the entire codebase.

- `Minor` versions are incremented when the mod gets ported to a new version of the game or when huge features are
  added /
  upstream changes are implemented.

- `Patch` versions are incremented when bug fixes are made or small features are added, they are the usual version
  increment.
