  <p><strong>Minecraft Fabric mod which allows you to join <em>every</em> Minecraft server version (Classic, Alpha, Beta, Release, April Fools, Bedrock)</strong></p>
</div>

**ViaFabricPlus** is a Minecraft mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) that builds on
the [ViaVersion plugin](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaVersion).
It lets you connect to servers from almost every Minecraft version while fixing issues that the original project
couldn't.

These fixes make older servers feel much closer to how they originally played, with improvements to movement, block and
entity interactions, graphics, and more. In short, it recreates the classic Minecraft experience on today's client.

## Important to know

- Works **only with the newest Minecraft client version**
- Runs **only on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)**. (There won't be a Forge or NeoForge version)
- **Multiplayer only** – it does not affect singleplayer worlds
- **Clientside only** - it does not run on Multiplayer servers
- **No cross-version resource packs** – resource packs from older versions are not supported
- If you want to play using **older Minecraft clients**, you should use the original [ViaFabric](https://viaversion.com/fabric) instead.
  For a detailed comparison between the two projects, check out the [ViaFabric vs ViaFabricPlus section](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabric?tab=readme-ov-file#differences-with-viafabricplus).
