  <p><strong>Minecraft Fabric mod which allows you to join <em>every</em> Minecraft server version (Classic, Alpha, Beta, Release, April Fools, Bedrock)</strong></p>
</div>

# Why another protocol translator?

ViaFabricPlus implements the [ViaVersion projects](https://github.com/ViaVersion) into Fabric and provides tons of fixes
to the existing protocol translation which can't be implemented in the original ViaVersion project.
These fixes consist of movement changes, block/entity collisions, rendering changes, and many more.

At the time of writing, ViaFabricPlus is the only mod that supports joining all Minecraft server versions down to the
first multiplayer version while implementing
legacy combat mechanics, movement, and rendering changes to make the gameplay feel more like the old days.

**On the other hand, ViaFabricPlus supports only the latest Minecraft client version, and only Fabric.**
If you need ViaFabricPlus for older versions of the game, you can use [ViaFabric](https://viaversion.com/fabric)
